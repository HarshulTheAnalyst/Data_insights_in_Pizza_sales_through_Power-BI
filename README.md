## DAX in Power BI

**Valuable Insights and Recommendations:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Weekly Highlights:**

üéâ The Daily Trends chart indicates the highest sales on Fridays and Saturdays, suggesting that weekends are peak times for orders. Hence, I can recommend the company to consider running special promotions or discounts during these days.

**Monthly Insights:**

üìÜ üçï The highest orders came in the months of July and January, while the lowest orders came in the months of February, September, and October, so I can recommend the company to run special promotions or events during these low-performing months to increase sales.

**Pizza Category Insights:**

üçïü•á The Classic pizza category leads with a remarkable 26.91% market share, making it a top choice among our customers. To sustain and increase its popularity, consider exploring new variations or promotional campaigns.

**Pizza Size Insights:**

üçïüçïüçï When it comes to pizza sales by size, "Large" pizzas dominate the market with a substantial 45.89% share. They are followed by "Medium" pizzas at 30.49% and "X-Large" pizzas at 21.77%.

Given the preference for Large pizzas, consider bundle deals or discounts for larger sizes. This could encourage customers to order more pizzas per order. Also launching special offers and discounts on XL adn XXL pizzas due to very low sales.

**Conclusion:**
